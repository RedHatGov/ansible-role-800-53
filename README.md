## Project Moved!

NIST 800-53 playbooks now ship as part of RHEL and Fedora! This project is now EOL. The URL/repo will be archived on 1-JUNE-2018.

Official Red Hat security automation content, which includes SCAP and Ansible, is developed through the [SCAP Security Guide](https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide/) project. The content is delivered natively in RHEL (``yum install scap-security-guide``), available through the [NIST National Checklist](https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/checklist/811), or [on Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/Ansible-Security-Compliance/).
